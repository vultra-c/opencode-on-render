# opencode on Render

Run opencode as a hosted AI coding agent with the browser UI and `opencode attach`.

[![Deploy to Render](https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg)](https://render.com/deploy-template/api/github/start?template_repo=opencode-on-render)

## What you get

- A single Render Web Service running `opencode web`
- The built-in opencode web UI on your Render URL
- Remote TUI access with `opencode attach`
- A 1 GB persistent disk for opencode state and your working tree
- Optional repo cloning into `/root/project-data/workspace` on first boot
- The Render OpenCode plugin installed by default

## How to use it

### From your browser

Deploy the template, then open the Render service URL.

Log in with:

- Username: `opencode`
- Password: the generated `OPENCODE_SERVER_PASSWORD` value in the Render Dashboard

### From your terminal

Install opencode locally:

```bash
npm install -g opencode-ai
```

Attach to your hosted backend:

```bash
opencode attach https://your-service.onrender.com
```

Use the generated password when prompted. You can also pass it directly:

```bash
opencode attach https://your-service.onrender.com \
  --username opencode \
  --password "$OPENCODE_SERVER_PASSWORD"
```

## Bring your own repo

Set `REPO_URL` during deploy to clone a working tree into `/root/project-data/workspace` on first boot.

For a public repo:

```txt
REPO_URL=https://github.com/your-org/your-repo.git
```

For a specific branch:

```txt
REPO_URL=https://github.com/your-org/your-repo.git
REPO_BRANCH=main
```

For a private GitHub repo, also set `GITHUB_TOKEN` to a token that can read the repo.

The startup script only clones when `/root/project-data/workspace` is empty. If `/root/project-data/workspace` already has files, it leaves them alone.

If you do not set `REPO_URL`, the service creates a small default Git project in `/root/project-data/workspace` so the web UI has a project to open.

## Server command

The template defaults to:

```txt
OPENCODE_SERVER_COMMAND=web
```

That starts the opencode web UI and API on the same Render URL.

If you want the headless API server instead, set:

```txt
OPENCODE_SERVER_COMMAND=serve
```

## Configured providers

Set one or more provider keys in Render:

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` unlocks Anthropic models.
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` unlocks OpenRouter models.
- `RENDER_API_KEY` unlocks Render MCP tools.

The service writes these keys into `/root/project-data/opencode/auth.json` using opencode's API-key auth format.

Anthropic OAuth is not supported in this hosted setup. Use `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.

## What's pre-wired

The image installs the Render OpenCode plugin from GitHub. It adds:

- `render_validate_blueprint`
- automatic validation when an agent edits `render.yaml` or `render.yml`
- `/deploy-to-render`
- `/check-render-status`
- the `@render` subagent
- bundled Render skills

The startup script also merges the Render MCP server into `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "mcp": {
    "render": {
      "type": "remote",
      "url": "https://mcp.render.com/mcp",
      "enabled": true,
      "oauth": false,
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer {env:RENDER_API_KEY}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Set `RENDER_API_KEY` in Render before asking opencode to manage Render resources.

## Disk size

The template starts with a 1 GB persistent disk mounted at:

```txt
/root/project-data
```

The startup script uses that disk for:

- `/root/project-data/opencode` for opencode auth, sessions, and SQLite state
- `/root/project-data/workspace` for the repo or project files the agent edits

To resize it, edit `render.yaml`:

```yaml
disk:
  name: opencode-data
  mountPath: /root/project-data
  sizeGB: 5
```

Then deploy the updated Blueprint.

## Known limitations

- Anthropic OAuth login does not work for hosted opencode. Use `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.
- The opencode web UI fetches assets from opencode's CDN at runtime.
- This is single-tenant. Do not share one deployment with multiple users.
- `/root/project-data/workspace` persists across restarts and deploys, but you should still commit and push important work back to your repo.
- The image preinstalls TypeScript language server only. Other language servers can be installed in your repo or a fork of this template.
